# Cloud Cluster Project

<h3><b>Overall Project Goal</b>

The project has several goals.

First, it is intended to introduce you to the concepts and aspects that are specific to cloud-scale data management systems. 

Second, it gives you a chance to acquire practical experience with a cloud-scale data management system of your choice. 

Third is for you to experience what a real-world data team would accomplish in their day to day work, starting from understanding the system and explaining its capabilities to a potential client, to designing a data model for your clientâ€™s data (ideally for optimum performance on common queries), and finally implementing that model and providing a final report with results and reflection.
